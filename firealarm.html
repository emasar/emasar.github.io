        <h1><span>Fire Alarm System</span></h1>
        <p>
          A fire alarm is a unit made of several devices, which uses visual and audio signalization to warn people about a possible fire, smoke, or carbon monoxide occurrence in the area of coverage. Fire alarms are usually set in fire alarm systems to provide zonal coverage for residences and commercial buildings. The warning signal is either a loud siren/bell or a flashing light, or it can include both. Some fire alarm systems use additional warnings, such as sending a voice message or making a phone call.

          Depending on the functionality and the integrated components, there are several classifications of fire alarm systems.<br><br>
 
          1. Automatic fire alarm systems are activated through fire detectors, such as smoke or heat sensors. Manual fire alarms are activated with manual call points or pull stations. There is no reason for a fire alarm system to exclude one or the other. Both can be included in the same system.<br><br>
          2. Conventional fire alarms work as one unit and cannot pinpoint the exact area of activation unless inspected. Addressable fire alarms have a specially dedicated address for each fire alarm detector that is connected to the control panel, for easier identification of the source of the danger.<br><br>
          3. One-stage fire alarm systems warn everyone in the building that a sensor has been activated. Two-stage fire alarm systems warn only certain people who are authorized to take appropriate action before the second stage. This system is designed to serve large public areas (for example, healthcare facilities) to prevent panic and inadequate frightful response.

            <h3>Working Priciples of Fire Alarm with Access Control System</h3>
        <p>
          Most building and office operators would agree that fire alarms are necessary, and, in fact, it would be extremely reckless to install an access control system that doesn’t meet all fire safety measures. It's recommended to implement an access control system that fully integrates with fire alarms and any other safety sensors on the property. So to paint a better picture, imagine this: A fire breaks out in the building, which triggers the fire alarm. The fire alarm will then trigger the backup power controller to unlock the doors for people to safely exit. And that’s it!
