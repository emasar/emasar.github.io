        <h1><span>Electrical Wiring System</span></h1>
        <p>
          What is Electrical Wiring:<br>
          Electrical Wiring is a process of connecting cables and wires to the related devices such as fuse, switches, sockets, lights, fans etc to the main distribution board is a specific structure to the utility pole for continues power supply.<br>The switch and light feeds are carried round the circuit in a series of loops from one point to another until the last on the circuit is reached. The phase or line conductors are looped either in switchboard or box and neutrals are looped either in switchboard or from light or fan. Line or phase should never be looped from light or fan.

         <h3>Batten Wiring (CTS or TRS):</h3>
         <p>
          Single core or double core or three core TRS cables with a circular oval shape cables are used in this kind of wiring.<br> Mostly, single core cables are preferred. TRS cables are chemical proof, water proof, steam proof, but are slightly affected by lubricating oil. The TRS cables are run on well seasoned and straight teak wood batten with at least a thickness of 10mm.<br>

          The cables are held on the wooden batten by means of tinned brass link clips (buckle clip) already fixed on the batten with brass pins and spaced at an interval of 10cm for horizontal runs and 15cm for vertical runs.

         <h3>Conduit Wiring:</h3>
         <p>
          There are two additional types of conduit wiring according to pipe installation:<br><br>
 
          (1) Surface Conduit Wiring<br>
          (2) Concealed Conduit Wiring<br>
          (3) Surface Conduit Wiring<br><br>
          If conduits installed on roof or wall, It is known as surface conduit wiring. in this wiring method, they make holes on the surface of wall on equal distances and conduit is installed then with the help of rawal plugs.<br><br>

          Concealed Conduit wiring
          If the conduits is hidden inside the wall slots with the help of plastering, it is called concealed conduit wiring. In other words, the electrical wiring system inside wall, roof or floor with the help of plastic or metallic piping is called concealed conduit wiring. obliviously, It is the most popular, beautiful, stronger and common electrical wiring system nowadays.<br><br>
          In conduit wiring, steel tubes known as conduits are installed on the surface of walls by means of pipe hooks (surface conduit wiring) or buried in walls under plaster and VIR or PVC cables are afterwards drawn by means of a GI wire of size if about 18SWG.<br>

          In Conduit wiring system, The conduits should be electrically continuous and connected to earth at some suitable points in case of steel conduit. Conduit wiring is a professional way of wiring a building. Mostly PVC conduits are used in domestic wiring.<br><br>

          The conduit protects the cables from being damaged by rodents (when rodents bites the cables it will cause short circuit) that is why circuit breakers are in place though but hey! Prevention is better than cure. Lead conduits are used in factories or when the building is prone to fire accident. Trunking is more of like surface conduit wiring. Itâ€™s gaining popularity too.

          It is done by screwing a PVC trunking pipe to a wall then passing the cables through the pipe. The cables in conduit should not be too tight. Space factor have to be put into consideration.

        <h3>Types of Conduit</h3>
        <p>
          Following conduits are used in the conduit wiring systems (both concealed and surface conduit wiring):<br><br>

          (1) Metallic Conduit<br>
          (2) Non-metallic conduit<br><br>
          Metallic Conduit:
          Metallic conduits are made of steel which are very strong but costly as well.<br>

          There are two types of metallic conduits:<br>

          Class A Conduit: Low gauge conduit (Thin layer steel sheet conduit)<br>
          Class B Conduit: High gauge conduit (Thick sheet of steel conduit)<br><br>
          Non-metallic Conduit:
          A solid PVC conduit is used as non-metallic conduit now a days, which is flexible and easy to bend.

        <h3> Difference Between Industrial and Residential Wiring</h3>
        <p>
          The differences between industrial wiring and domestic/residential wiring are the insulation, voltage load, and installation process.<br> Residential wiring is typically run through walls and attic crawl spaces in a single phase design, and it uses less voltage due to lower electrical load.<br> Industrial wiring uses a three-phase design to create higher output to power high voltage equipment and multiple systems. Heavy-duty insulation protects industrial wiring from corrosive liquids or gasses. Sensitive and power-hungry machinery often require special, heavy-duty outlets.

        <h3> What Is the Difference Between an Industrial and Commercial Electrician</h3>
        <p>
          The main difference between an industrial and commercial electrician is their work environment.<br><br> A commercial electrician typically works in commercial buildings, like retail stores and restaurants ensuring that the wiring and electrical components are operating safely and efficiently , same is applied to residential electrician.<br><br> An industrial electrician, on the other hand, normally works in manufacturing plants and production facilities with complex, sensitive, and expensive machinery and electrical systems.<br> Industrial electricians maintain a more extensive range of electrical systems, from micro-currents to high voltage components.
