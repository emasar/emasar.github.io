          A website is a collection of publicly accessible, interlinked Web pages that share a single domain name. Websites can be created and maintained by an individual, group, business or organization to serve a variety of purposes.<br>
          Together, all publicly accessible websites constitute the World Wide Web.Although it is sometimes called “web page,” this definition is wrong, since a website consists of several webpages. A website is also known as a “web presence” or simply “site”.<br><br>
          Websites come in a nearly endless variety, including educational sites, news sites, porn sites, forums, social media sites, e-commerce sites, and so on. The pages within a website are usually a mix of text and other media. That said, there are no rules dictating the form of a website.<br>

        <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
        <p>
          Websites consist of two parts: the front end, which users experience, and the back end, which comprises the invisible structure making the front end possible. The difference between front-end and back-end development can seem confusing, given their similarities in making websites function properly.<br><br>

          Front-end developers design the visual aspects of websites for users to interact with, including colors, layout, and fonts. Back-end developers create the invisible structure that helps websites function properly. Back-end developers have a different technical skillset and make higher salaries than front-end developers.<br><br>

          Full-stack developers work with all parts of a website and use front-end and back-end coding skills. Keep reading to learn more about front-end vs. back-end development, including key proficiencies required for both focuses.

        <p>
          Front-end development focuses on the user-facing side of a website. Front-end developers ensure that visitors can easily interact with and navigate sites by using programming languages, design skills, and other tools. They produce the drop-down menus, layouts, and designs for websites.<br>

          Front-end devs use computer programming languages like JavaScript, HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to design websites. Each language serves a unique purpose. HTML lays out the site's content and structure, CSS adds design features, and JavaScript creates advanced interactive features. Less commonly, front-end devs know other programming languages like Python, PHP, or Ruby.<br><br>

          These developers need expertise using frameworks and libraries like jQuery, Bootstrap, AngularJS, and EmberJS. Frameworks ensure that content appears correctly on all devices, while libraries condense code into smaller, time-saving packages. Front-end devs may also use graphic design programs like Photoshop or Sketch, along with code editing tools like Notepad or Eclipse.<br>

          Front-end development requires technical expertise and creativity to ensure websites' user interfaces look correct and function properly. Front-end devs work with back-end developers, designers, and user experience analysts.
